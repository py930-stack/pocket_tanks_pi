## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

- If you see errors like `pygame.error: No available video device`,  
  make sure you‚Äôre running in a desktop environment (not SSH-only).  
- For laggy performance, lower resolution in `pocket_tanks_pi.py`:
  ```python
  WIDTH, HEIGHT = 800, 480   # smaller window for speed
  ```
- If `pygame-ce` doesn‚Äôt work, try classic `pygame`:
  ```bash
  pip install pygame
  ```
